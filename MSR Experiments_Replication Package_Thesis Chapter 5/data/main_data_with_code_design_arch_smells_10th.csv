Contains:

HADOOP-16474. S3Guard ProgressiveRenameTracker to mark destination
              dirirectory as authoritative on success.
HADOOP-16684. S3guard bucket info to list a bit more about
              authoritative paths.
HADOOP-16722. S3GuardTool to support FilterFileSystem.

This patch improves the marking of newly created/import directory
trees in S3Guard DynamoDB tables as authoritative.

Specific changes:

 * Renamed directories are marked as authoritative if the entire
   operation succeeded (HADOOP-16474).
 * When updating parent table entries as part of any table write,
   there's no overwriting of their authoritative flag.

s3guard import changes:

* new -verbose flag to print out what is going on.

* The ""s3guard import"" command lets you declare that a directory tree
is to be marked as authoritative

  hadoop s3guard import -authoritative -verbose s3a://bucket/path

When importing a listing and a file is found, the import tool queries
the metastore and only updates the entry if the file is different from
before, where different == new timestamp, etag, or length. S3Guard can get
timestamp differences due to clock skew in PUT operations.

As the recursive list performed by the import command doesn't retrieve the
versionID, the existing entry may in fact be more complete.
When updating an existing due to clock skew the existing version ID
is propagated to the new entry (note: the etags must match; this is needed
to deal with inconsistent listings).

There is a new s3guard command to audit a s3guard bucket/path's
authoritative state:

  hadoop s3guard authoritative -check-config s3a://bucket/path

This is primarily for testing/auditing.

The s3guard bucket-info command also provides some more details on the
authoritative state of a store (HADOOP-16684).

This patch cuts down the size of directory trees used for
distcp contract tests against object stores, so making
them much faster against distant/slow stores.

On abfs, the test only runs with -Dscale (as was the case for s3a already),
and has the larger scale test timeout.

After every test case, the FileSystem IOStatistics are logged,
to provide information about what IO is taking place and
what it's performance is.

There are some test cases which upload files of 1+ MiB; you can
increase the size of the upload in the option
""scale.test.distcp.file.size.kb"" 
Set it to zero and the large file tests are skipped.

This migrates the fs.s3a-server-side encryption configuration options
to a name which covers client-side encryption too.

fs.s3a.server-side-encryption-algorithm becomes fs.s3a.encryption.algorithm
fs.s3a.server-side-encryption.key becomes fs.s3a.encryption.key

The existing keys remain valid, simply deprecated and remapped
to the new values. If you want server-side encryption options
to be picked up regardless of hadoop versions, use
the old keys.

(the old key also works for CSE, though as no version of Hadoop
with CSE support has shipped without this remapping, it's less
relevant)
